# Couch to 5k 

This sample data comes from "Couch to 5k", an NHS-sponsored fitness programme which lasts 9 weeks, taking participants from a gentle start up to a half-hour run. In this project, I was asked to analyse the data that has been collected from participants in 2 cities (Edinburgh and Glasgow), all of whom started the Couch to 5k programme, across the course of a year.

The researchers' have two primary interests:

-   They are interested in the psychological factors that make people continue on the programme

-    and in the effects of taking the programme on health and well-being.

At Week 0, all participants completed a questionnaire measuring the psychometric factors of accountability and self-motivation. Upon either completing the programme (Week 9) or dropping out (/< Week 9), participants completed a questionnaire which included a measure of their self-reported happiness, and a "health" measure derived from a number of physiological tests. Details of the data collected can be found in the table below.

**Please note that Couch to 5k is a real programme, but the data presented is simulated**
